/*
 * 
 * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * 
 * When you have found a repeated character (letâ€™s say at index j), it means that the current substring (excluding the repeated character of course) is a potential maximum, so update the maximum if necessary. It also means that the repeated character must have appeared before at an index i, where i is less than j.
 * Since you know that all substrings that start before or at index i would be less than your current maximum, you can safely start to look for the next substring with head which starts exactly at index i+1.
